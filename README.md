stream8.js
==========

Map-reduce operations based on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Java8's Stream</a>. I'm targeting a subset of these as it is tailored to the differences in Javascript such as loose typing and how 'this' is handled.

To get started you can include Stream8 with bower using <code>"stream8": "~0.1.1"</code>
